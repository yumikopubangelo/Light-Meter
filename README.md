# Light-Meter

During my internship at UGM (Gadjah Mada University), I collaborated with three of my peers on various projects, one of which was focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). In this particular project, we developed a Light Meter, a device designed to measure the light intensity in a room. The Light Meter consisted of two main modules: the first module was responsible for measuring the overall light intensity in the room, while the second module focused on measuring the light intensity directed specifically at its light sensor.

This project was commissioned by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) and was part of our effort to meet their IoT-related needs. Given the IoT nature of the project, we opted not to use GitHub or similar code collaboration platforms. Instead, we chose tools and communication methods more suited to the IoT project environment.

At the time, we believed that the approach we took was the most suitable and effective for delivering a product that met the specifications and requirements of our client. This project provided us with valuable experience in designing, developing, and implementing practical and relevant IoT solutions.
